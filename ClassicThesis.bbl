    \field{abstract}{%
    Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder
  order transition called "folding." The protein polymer is highly flexible
  when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when
  folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic
  measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules,
  elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the
  former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between
  the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of
  solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of
  approximately 35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of
  hydrogen-bonded structural elements, alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Anfinsen
  showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a
  protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for
  self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open
  question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly
  proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed
  over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this
  view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process,
  driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having
  taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing
  side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds
  dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state.
  Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited
  repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct
  hydrogen-bonded arrangement of alpha-helices and/or strands of beta-sheet.%

    Models of protein energetics that neglect interactions between amino acids
  that are not adjacent in the native state, such as the Go model, encode or
  underlie many influential ideas on protein folding. Implicit in this
  simplification is a crucial assumption that has never been critically
  evaluated in a broad context: Detailed mechanisms of protein folding are not
  biased by nonnative contacts, typically argued to be a consequence of
  sequence design and/or topology. Here we present, using computer simulations
  of a well-studied lattice heteropolymer model, the first systematic test of
  this oft-assumed correspondence over the statistically significant range of
  hundreds of thousands of amino acid sequences that fold to the same native
  structure. Contrary to previous conjectures, we find a multiplicity of
  folding mechanisms, suggesting that Go-like models cannot be justified by
  considerations of topology alone. Instead, we find that the crucial factor in
  discriminating among topological pathways is the heterogeneity of native
  contact energies: The order in which native contacts accumulate is profoundly
  insensitive to omission of nonnative interactions, provided that native
  contact heterogeneity is retained. This robustness holds over a surprisingly
  wide range of folding rates for our designed sequences. Mirroring predictions
  based on the principle of minimum frustration, fast-folding sequences match
  their Go-like counterparts in both topological mechanism and transit times.
  Less optimized sequences dwell much longer in the unfolded state and/or
  off-pathway intermediates than do Go-like models. For dynamics that bridge
  unfolded and unfolded states, however, even slow folders exhibit topological
  mechanisms and transit times nearly identical with those of their Go-like
  counterparts. Our results do not imply a direct correspondence between
  folding trajectories of Go-like models and those of real proteins, but they
  do help to clarify key topological and energetic assumptions that are
  commonly used to justify such caricatures.%

    Attempts to answer the Levinthal question "How proteins fold to give such a
  unique structure" are discussed. In the first part of this article, we focus
  on a few reasons as to why the solution to the protein-folding problem (PFP)
  has been elusive for a very long time. One is a result of the
  misinterpretation of Anfinsen's Thermodynamic hypothesis which led to the
  conclusion that the native structure of a protein must be at a global minimum
  of the Gibbs energy. The second is the result of the adherence to the
  hydrophobic paradigm, and at the same time ignoring a whole repertoire of
  hydrophilic effects. It is argued that switching from a target-based to a
  caused-based approach, and adopting the hydrophilic paradigm leads
  straightforwardly to a simple answer to Levinthal's question, as well as to a
  solution of the PFP.%

    This article is an introduction to the special issue of the journal
  PROTEINS, dedicated to the tenth Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction
  (CASP) experiment to assess the state of the art in protein structure
  modeling. The article describes the conduct of the experiment, the categories
  of prediction included, and outlines the evaluation and assessment
  procedures. The 10 CASP experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the
  field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in
  methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first
  sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular
  dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to
  make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such
  as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging
  results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding
  considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in CASP testing. The nature
  of CASP targets has been changing in recent CASPs, reflecting shifts in
  experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more
  multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of
  known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see
  steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting
  from improvement of non-template regions.%

    Genome sequencing projects are producing linear amino acid sequences, but
  full understanding of the biological role of these proteins will require
  knowledge of their structure and function. Although experimental structure
  determination methods are providing high-resolution structure information
  about a subset of the proteins, computational structure prediction methods
  will provide valuable information for the large fraction of sequences whose
  structures will not be determined experimentally. The first class of protein
  structure prediction methods, including threading and comparative modeling,
  rely on detectable similarity spanning most of the modeled sequence and at
  least one known structure. The second class of methods, de novo or ab initio
  methods, predict the structure from sequence alone, without relying on
  similarity at the fold level between the modeled sequence and any of the
  known structures. In this Viewpoint, we begin by describing the essential
  features of the methods, the accuracy of the models, and their application to
  the prediction and understanding of protein function, both for single
  proteins and on the scale of whole genomes. We then discuss the important
  role that protein structure prediction methods play in the growing worldwide

    Protein structure prediction is one of the major challenges in
  bioinformatics today. Throughout the past five decades, many different
  algorithmic approaches have been attempted, and although progress has been
  made the problem remains unsolvable even for many small proteins. While the
  general objective is to predict the three-dimensional structure from primary
  sequence, our current knowledge and computational power are simply
  insufficient to solve a problem of such high complexity. Some prediction
  algorithms do, however, appear to perform better than others, although it is
  not always obvious which ones they are and it is perhaps even less obvious
  why that is. In this review, the reported performance results from 18
  different recently published prediction algorithms are compared. Furthermore,
  the general algorithmic settings most likely responsible for the difference
  in the reported performance are identified, and the specific settings of each
  of the 18 prediction algorithms are also compared. The average normalized
  r.m.s.d. scores reported range from 11.17 to 3.48. With a performance measure
  including both r.m.s.d. scores and CPU time, the currently best-performing
  prediction algorithm is identified to be the I-TASSER algorithm. Two of the
  algorithmic settings--protein representation and fragment assembly--were
  found to have definite positive influence on the running time and the
  predicted structures, respectively. There thus appears to be a clear benefit
  from incorporating this knowledge in the design of new prediction
  algorithms.%

    BACKGROUND: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid
  sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational
  structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure
  Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective
  assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as
  the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our
  laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public
  availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER
  predictions. RESULTS: An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU
  Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions
  for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring
  function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and
  the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is
  introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A
  large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the
  C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in
  [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a
  C-score cutoff {\textgreater} -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both
  false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and
  protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an
  average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 A for RMSD. CONCLUSION: The I-TASSER
  server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein
  structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to
  obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the
  I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the
  confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation
  of the estimations. The I-TASSER server is freely available to the academic
  community at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/I-TASSER.%

    Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given
  protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more
  proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of
  fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model
  evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the
  accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in
  the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the
  modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak
  sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling
  of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as
  detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible
  to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of
  all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in
  biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new
  challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents
  of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and
  structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated,
  rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline
  applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage
  new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large
  number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional
  network.%

    Sequence comparison is a major step in the prediction of protein structure
  from existing templates in the Protein Data Bank. The identification of
  potentially remote homologues to be used as templates for modeling target
  sequences of unknown structure and their accurate alignment remain
  challenges, despite many years of study. The most recent advances have been
  in combining as many sources of information as possible - including amino
  acid variation in the form of profiles or hidden Markov models for both the
  target and template families, known and predicted secondary structures of the
  template and target, respectively, the combination of structure alignment for
  distant homologues and sequence alignment for close homologues to build
  better profiles, and the anchoring of certain regions of the alignment based
  on existing biological data. Newer technologies have been applied to the
  problem, including the use of support vector machines to tackle the fold
  classification problem for a target sequence and the alignment of hidden
  Markov models. Finally, using the consensus of many fold recognition methods,
  whether based on profile-profile alignments, threading or other approaches,
  continues to be one of the most successful strategies for both recognition
  and alignment of remote homologues. Although there is still room for
  improvement in identification and alignment methods, additional progress may
  come from model building and refinement methods that can compensate for large
  structural changes between remotely related targets and templates, as well as
  for regions of misalignment. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.%

    The pattern of residue substitution in divergently evolving families of
  globular proteins is highly variable. At each position in a fold there are
  constraints on the identities of amino acids from both the three-dimensional
  structure and the function of the protein. To characterize and quantify the
  structural constraints, we have made a comparative analysis of families of
  homologous globular proteins. Residues are classified according to amino acid
  type, secondary structure, accessibility of the sidechain, and existence of
  hydrogen bonds from sidechain to other sidechains or peptide carbonyl or
  amide functions. There are distinct patterns of substitution especially where
  residues are both solvent inaccessible and hydrogen bonded through their
  sidechains. The patterns of residue substitution can be used to construct
  templates or to identify 'key' residues if one or more structures are known.
  Conversely, analysis of conversation and substitution across a large family
  of aligned sequences in terms of substitution profiles can allow prediction
  of tertiary environment or indicate a functional role. Similar analyses can
  be used to test the validity of putative structures if several homologous
  sequences are available.%

    As more and more protein structures are determined, there is increasing
  interest in the question of how many different folds have been used in
  biology. The history of the rate of discovery of new folds and the
  distribution of sequence families among known folds provide a means of
  estimating the underlying distribution of fold use. Previous models
  exploiting these data have led to rather different conclusions on the total
  number of folds. We present a new model, based on the notion that the folds
  used in biology fall naturally into three classes: unifolds, that is, folds
  found only in a single narrow sequence family; mesofolds, found in an
  intermediate number of families; and the previously noted superfolds, found
  in many protein families. We show that this model fits the available data
  well and has predicted the development of SCOP over the past 2 years. The
  principle implications of the model are as follows: (1) The vast majority of
  folds will be found in only a single sequence family; (2) the total number of
  folds is at least 10,000; and (3) 80{\%} of sequence families have one of
  about 400 folds, most of which are already known.%

    In the fifty years since the first atomic structure of a protein was
  revealed, tens of thousands of additional structures have been solved. Like
  all objects in biology, proteins structures show common patterns that seem to
  define family relationships. Classification of proteins structures, which
  started in the 1970s with about a dozen structures, has continued with
  increasing enthusiasm, leading to two main fold classifications, SCOP and
  CATH, as well as many additional databases. Classification is complicated by
  deciding what constitutes a domain, the fundamental unit of structure. Also
  difficult is deciding when two given structures are similar. Like all of
  biology, fold classification is beset by exceptions to all rules. Thus, the
  perspectives of protein fold space that the fold classifications offer differ
  from each other. In spite of these ambiguities, fold classifications are
  useful for prediction of structure and function. Studying the characteristics
  of fold space can shed light on protein evolution and the physical laws that
  govern protein behavior.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Much experimental work has been devoted in comparing the folding behavior
  of proteins sharing the same fold but different sequence. The recent design
  of proteins displaying very high sequence identities but different 3D
  structure allows the unique opportunity to address the protein-folding
  problem from a complementary perspective. Here we explored by $\Phi$-value
  analysis the pathways of folding of three different heteromorphic pairs,
  displaying increasingly high-sequence identity (namely, 30{\%}, 77{\%}, and
  88{\%}), but different structures called G(A) (a 3-$\alpha$ helix fold) and
  G(B) (an $\alpha$/$\beta$ fold). The analysis, based on 132 site-directed
  mutants, is fully consistent with the idea that protein topology is committed
  very early along the pathway of folding. Furthermore, data reveals that when
  folding approaches a perfect two-state scenario, as in the case of the G(A)
  domains, the structural features of the transition state appear very robust
  to changes in sequence composition. On the other hand, when folding is more
  complex and multistate, as for the G(B)s, there are alternative nuclei or
  accessible pathways that can be alternatively stabilized by altering the
  primary structure. The implications of our results in the light of previous
  work on the folding of different members belonging to the same protein family
  are discussed.%

    The "protein folding problem" consists of three closely related puzzles:
  (a) What is the folding code? (b) What is the folding mechanism? (c) Can we
  predict the native structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence? Once
  regarded as a grand challenge, protein folding has seen great progress in
  recent years. Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being
  designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures
  of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And,
  there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A
  protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller
  local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from
  peptide fragments, local structures first.%

    The protein-folding problem was first posed about one half-century ago. The
  term refers to three broad questions: (i) What is the physical code by which
  an amino acid sequence dictates a protein's native structure? (ii) How can
  proteins fold so fast? (iii) Can we devise a computer algorithm to predict
  protein structures from their sequences? We review progress on these
  problems. In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in
  chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small
  proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal
  motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward
  the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy
  landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known
  structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was
  thought possible in the early days. What began as three questions of basic
  science one half-century ago has now grown into the full-fledged research
  field of protein physical science.%

    The folding reactions of some small proteins show clear evidence of a
  hierarchic process, whereas others, lacking detectable intermediates, do not.
  Evidence from folding intermediates and transition states suggests that
  folding begins locally, and that the formation of native secondary structure
  precedes the formation of tertiary interactions, not the reverse. Some
  notable examples in the literature have been interpreted to the contrary. For
  these examples, we have simulated the local structures that form when folding
  begins by using the LINUS program with nonlocal interactions turned off. Our
  results support a hierarchic model of protein folding.%

    A predictive rule for protein folding is presented that involves two

  helices. In proteins, helices that terminated in glycine residues were found
  predominantly in one of these two motifs. These glycine structures had a
  characteristic pattern of polar and apolar residues. Visual inspection of
  known helical sequences was sufficient to distinguish the two motifs from
  each other and from internal glycines that fail to terminate helices. These
  glycine motifs--in which the local sequence selects between available

    We have studied the architecture of parallel beta-sheets in proteins and
  focused on the residues that initiate and terminate the beta-strands. These
  beta-breaker residues are at the origin of the kink between the beta-strand
  and the turn that precedes or follows it. beta-Breakers can be located
  automatically using a consensus approach based on algorithmic secondary
  structure assignment, solvent accessibility and backbone dihedral angles.
  These beta-breakers are conformationally homogeneous with respect to
  side-chain solvent accessibility and backbone dihedral angle profile. A
  sequence-structure correlation is noted: a restricted subset of amino acids
  is observed at these positions. Analysis of homologous protein sequences
  shows that these residues are more highly conserved than other residues in
  the loop. We conclude that beta-breakers are the structural analogs of the N
  and C-terminal caps of alpha-helices. The identification of this aperiodic
  substructure suggests a strategy for improving secondary structure prediction
  and may guide site-directed mutagenesis experiments.%

    The following three issues concerning the backbone dihedral angles of
  protein structures are presented. (1) How do the dihedral angles of the 20
  amino acids depend on the identity and conformation of their nearest
  residues? (2) To what extent are the native dihedral angles determined by
  local (dihedral) potentials? (3) How to build a knowledge-based potential for
  a residue's dihedral angles, considering the identity and conformation of its
  nearest residues? We find that the dihedral angle distribution for a residue
  can significantly depend on the identity and conformation of its adjacent
  residues. These correlations are in sharp contrast to the Flory isolated-pair
  hypothesis. Statistical potentials are built for all combinations of residue
  triplets and depend on the dihedral angles between consecutive residues.
  First, a low-resolution potential is obtained, which only differentiates
  between the main populated basins in the dihedral angle density plots.
  Minimization of the dihedral potential for 125 test proteins reveals that
  most native alpha-helical residues (89{\%}) and a large fraction of native
  beta-sheet residues (47{\%}) adopt conformations close to their native one.
  For native loop residues, the percentage is 48{\%}. It is also found that
  this fraction is higher for residues away from the ends of alpha or beta
  secondary structure elements. In addition, a higher resolution potential is
  built as a function of dihedral angles by a smoothing procedure and
  continuous functions interpolations. Monte Carlo energy minimization with
  this potential results in a lower fraction for native beta-sheet residues.
  Nevertheless, because of the higher flexibility and entropy of beta
  structures, they could be preferred under the influence of non-local
  interactions. In general, most alpha-helices and many beta-sheets are
  strongly determined by the local potential, while the conformations in loops
  and near the end of beta-sheets are more influenced by non-local
  interactions.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The importance of thorough analyses of the secondary structures in proteins
  as basic structural units cannot be overemphasized. Although recent
  computational methods have achieved reasonably high accuracy for predicting
  secondary structures from amino acid sequences, a simple and fundamental
  empirical approach to characterize the amino acid composition of secondary
  structures was performed mainly in 1970s, with a small number of analyzed
  structures. To extend this classical approach using a large number of
  analyzed structures, here we characterized the amino acid sequences of
  secondary structures (12 154 alpha-helix units, 4592 3(10)-helix units, 16
  787 beta-strand units, and 30 811 "other" units), using the representative
  three-dimensional protein structure records (1641 protein chains) from the
  Protein Data Bank. We first examined the length and the amino acid
  compositions of secondary structures, including rank order differences and
  assignment relationships among amino acids. These compositional results were
  largely, but not entirely, consistent with the previous studies. In addition,
  we examined the frequency of 400 amino acid doublets and 8000 triplets in
  secondary structures based on their relative counts, termed the availability.
  We identified not only some triplets that were specific to a certain
  secondary structure but also so-called zero-count triplets, which did not
  occur in a given secondary structure at all, even though they were
  probabilistically predicted to occur several times. Taken together, the
  present study revealed essential features of secondary structures and
  suggests potential applications in the secondary structure prediction and the
  functional design of protein sequences.%

    Two major components are required for a successful prediction of the
  three-dimensional structure of peptides and proteins: an efficient global
  optimization procedure which is capable of finding an appropriate local
  minimum for the strongly anisotropic function of hundreds of variables, and a
  set of free energy components for a protein molecule in solution which are
  computationally inexpensive enough to be used in the search procedure, yet
  sufficiently accurate to ensure the uniqueness of the native conformation. We
  here found an efficient way to make a random step in a Monte Carlo procedure
  given knowledge of the energy or statistical properties of conformational
  subspaces (e.g. phi-psi zones or side-chain torsion angles). This biased
  probability Monte Carlo (BPMC) procedure randomly selects the subspace first,
  then makes a step to a new random position independent of the previous
  position, but according to the predefined continuous probability
  distribution. The random step is followed by a local minimization in torsion
  angle space. The positions, sizes and preferences for high-probability zones
  on phi-psi maps and chi-angle maps were calculated for different residue
  types from the representative set of 191 and 161 protein 3D-structures,
  respectively. A fast and precise method to evaluate the electrostatic energy
  of a protein in solution is developed and combined with the BPMC procedure.
  The method is based on the modified spherical image charge approximation,
  efficiently projected onto a molecule of arbitrary shape. Comparison with the
  finite-difference solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation shows high
  accuracy for our approach. The BPMC procedure is applied successfully to the
  structure prediction of 12- and 16-residue synthetic peptides and the
  determination of protein structure from NMR data, with the immunoglobulin
  binding domain of streptococcal protein G as an example. The BPMC runs
  display much better convergence properties than the non-biased simulations.
  The advantage of a true global optimization procedure for NMR structure
  determination is its ability to cope with local minima originating from data
  errors and ambiguities in NMR data.%

    We have explored the application of genetic algorithms (GA) to the
  determination of protein structure from sequence, using a full atom
  representation. A free energy function with point charge electrostatics and
  an area based solvation model is used. The method is found to be superior to
  previously investigated Monte Carlo algorithms. For selected fragments, up to
  14 residues long, the lowest free energy structures produced by the GA are
  similar in conformation to the corresponding experimental structures in most
  cases. There are three main conclusions from these results. First, the
  genetic algorithm is an effective method for searching amongst the compact
  conformations of a polypeptide chain. Second, the free energy function is
  generally able to select native-like conformations. However, some
  deficiencies are identified, and further development is proposed. Third, the
  selection of native-like conformations for some protein fragments establishes
  that in these cases the conformation observed in the full protein structure
  is largely context independent. The implications for the nature of protein
  folding pathways are discussed.%

  opposing the attendant reduction in sidechain conformational entropy on helix

    A cellular automaton is a decentralized computing model providing an
  excellent platform for performing complex computation with the help of only
  local information. Researchers, scientists and practitioners from different
  fields have exploited the CA paradigm of local information, decentralized
  control and universal computation for modeling different applications. This
  article provides a survey of available literature of some of the
  methodologies employed by researchers to utilize cellular automata for
  modeling purposes. The survey introduces the different types of cellular
  automata being used for modeling and the analytical methods used to predict
  its global behavior from its local configurations. It further gives a
  detailed sketch of the efforts undertaken to configure the local settings of
  CA from a given global situation; the problem which has been traditionally
  termed as the inverse problem. Finally, it presents the different fields in
  which CA have been applied. The extensive bibliography provided with the

    \field{abstract}{%
    Accurate prediction of protein secondary structure is essential for
  accurate sequence alignment, three-dimensional structure modeling, and
  function prediction. The accuracy of ab initio secondary structure prediction
  from sequence, however, has only increased from around 77 to 80{\%} over the
  past decade. Here, we developed a multistep neural-network algorithm by
  coupling secondary structure prediction with prediction of solvent
  accessibility and backbone torsion angles in an iterative manner. Our method
  called SPINE X was applied to a dataset of 2640 proteins (25{\%} sequence
  identity cutoff) previously built for the first version of SPINE and achieved
  a 82.0{\%} accuracy based on 10-fold cross validation (Q(3)). Surpassing
  81{\%} accuracy by SPINE X is further confirmed by employing an independently
  built test dataset of 1833 protein chains, a recently built dataset of 1975
  proteins and 117 CASP 9 targets (critical assessment of structure prediction
  techniques) with an accuracy of 81.3{\%}, 82.3{\%} and 81.8{\%},
  respectively. The prediction accuracy is further improved to 83.8{\%} for the
  dataset of 2640 proteins if the DSSP assignment used above is replaced by a
  more consistent consensus secondary structure assignment method. Comparison
  to the popular PSIPRED and CASP-winning structure-prediction techniques is
  made. SPINE X predicts number of helices and sheets correctly for 21.0{\%} of
  1833 proteins, compared to 17.6{\%} by PSIPRED. It further shows that SPINE X
  consistently makes more accurate prediction in helical residues (6{\%})
  without over prediction while PSIPRED makes more accurate prediction in coil
  residues (3-5{\%}) and over predicts them by 7{\%}. SPINE X Server and its
  training/test datasets are available at http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu/%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The tendency of a polypeptide chain to form alpha-helical or beta-strand
  secondary structure depends upon local and nonlocal effects. Local effects
  reflect the intrinsic propensities of the amino acid residues for particular
  secondary structures, while nonlocal effects reflect the positioning of the
  individual residues in the context of the entire amino acid sequence. In
  particular, the periodicity of polar and nonpolar residues specifies whether
  a given sequence is consistent with amphiphilic alpha-helices or
  beta-strands. The importance of intrinsic propensities was compared to that
  of polar/nonpolar periodicity by a direct competition. Synthetic peptides
  were designed using residues with intrinsic propensities that favored one or
  the other type of secondary structure. The polar/nonpolar periodicities of
  the peptides were designed either to be consistent with the secondary
  structure favored by the intrinsic propensities of the component residues or
  in other cases to oppose these intrinsic propensities. Characterization of
  the synthetic peptides demonstrated that in all cases the observed secondary
  structure correlates with the periodicity of the peptide sequence--even when
  this secondary structure differs from that predicted from the intrinsic
  propensities of the component amino acids. The observed secondary structures
  are concentration dependent, indicating that oligomerization of the
  amphiphilic peptides is responsible for the observed secondary structures.
  Thus, for self-assembling oligomeric peptides, the polar/nonpolar periodicity
  can overwhelm the intrinsic propensities of the amino acid residues and
  serves as the major determinant of peptide secondary structure.%

    In recent research the classifications of imbalanced data sets have

  data imbalance problem. Micro calcifications are very tiny deposits of
  calcium that appear as small bright spots in the mammogram. Classification of
  microcalcification clusters from mammograms plays an important role in

    Predicted assignments of biological sequences are often evaluated by
  Matthews correlation coefficient. However, Matthews correlation coefficient
  applies only to cases where the assignments belong to two categories, and
  cases with more than two categories are often artificially forced into two
  categories by considering what belongs and what does not belong to one of the
  categories, leading to the loss of information. Here, an extended correlation
  coefficient that applies to K-categories is proposed, and this measure is
  shown to be highly applicable for evaluating prediction of RNA secondary
  structure in cases where some predicted pairs go into the category
  “unknown” due to lack of reliability in predicted pairs or unpaired
  residues. Hence, predicting base pairs of RNA secondary structure can be a
  three-category problem. The measure is further shown to be well in agreement
  with existing performance measures used for ranking protein secondary
  structure predictions. Server and software is available at http://rk.kvl.dk/%
